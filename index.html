							<p>	priceera is a new CPQ pricing tool specifically tailored to the process industry,
								where complex pricing models are the norm.<br>
								Unlike most pricing solutions that predominantly serve discrete manufacturers and 
								retailers, priceera excels in dynamic, formula-driven pricing, making it ideal 
								for more challenging industries that deal in continuous and semi-continuous 
								processes with highly customized products.<br>
								Our solution significantly reduces pricing and quoting time while minimizing errors, 
								offering a streamlined and efficient experience. Designed to be cost-effective, 
								priceera minimizes the need for extensive customization, making it a smart 
								choice for SMEs and large enterprises seeking a robust pricing tool without 
								the substantial investment typically required by traditional CPQ CRM systems.</p>
